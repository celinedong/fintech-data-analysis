    "## 6.1 Insights from Post-Resampling Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlation analysis on the resampled training set provides several critical insights into our feature set and the effectiveness of our balancing strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Feature Engineering Validation\n",
    "* **High-Impact Ratios**: The engineered feature `loan_to_income` (0.347) has emerged as one of the top predictors of default. This validates our domain-driven approach—measuring the relative burden of debt is more telling than looking at `loan_amount` or `annual_income` in isolation.\n",
    "* **Cash Flow Signal**: `rev_to_loan_ratio` (-0.126) shows a strong negative correlation, confirming that businesses with higher revenue coverage relative to their debt are significantly lower risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Economic Logic Alignment\n",
    "* **Income & Loan Size**: `annual_income` (-0.382) and `loan_amount` (0.350) remain the \"anchor\" features. The model now has a much clearer decision boundary between high-income borrowers and high-debt seekers.\n",
    "* **Collateral Impact**: The presence of collateral (`has_collateral_yes`: -0.111) is a significant risk-mitigating factor, which aligns with standard credit risk theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The \"SMOTE Amplifier\" Effect\n",
    "* Compared to the raw EDA in Part 01, the correlation coefficients have become more pronounced. By balancing the classes, we have reduced the \"noise\" created by the majority class and allowed the underlying risk signals of the minority class (defaulters) to surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Strategic Implications for Modeling\n",
    "* Since the signals are now statistically stronger, our champion models (like XGBoost) will likely achieve higher **Recall** without sacrificing too much **Precision**.\n",
    "* **Observation on Credit Score**: While `credit_score` is not in the top 3, the financial ratios we built (incorporating income and revenue) have taken over as the primary drivers, providing a more holistic view of \"Ability to Pay\" vs. just \"Willingness to Pay.\""
