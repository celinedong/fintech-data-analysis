# ==============================================================================
# FINFLOW PRODUCTION CONFIGURATION
# Purpose: Centralize business logic and path management for weekly inference.
# Location: phase2_production_mlops/config/prod_config.yaml
# ==============================================================================

# 1. BUSINESS LOGIC & THRESHOLDS
# The optimal threshold was derived from the Profitability Curve in Notebook 04.
business_logic:
  # The probability cutoff where Net Interest Margin is maximized
  decision_threshold: 0.29 
  # Estimated loss per loan default (Principal)
  default_cost: 20000 
  # Estimated lost profit per rejected good customer (Interest)
  opportunity_cost: 5000 

# 2. SYSTEM PATHS (Absolute Paths for Windows)
# Centralized storage for model artifacts and data splits.
paths:
  # Path to the persisted champion model and metadata
  model_path: "C:/dev/quant_project/homework/model_storage/finflow_artifacts.joblib"
  # Directory containing training baselines and weekly incoming batches
  data_storage: "C:/dev/quant_project/homework/data_storage"
  # Destination for weekly logs and performance reports
  output_logs: "C:/dev/quant_project/homework/phase2_production_mlops/logs"

# 3. MLOps MONITORING PARAMETERS
# Thresholds for detecting data degradation over time.
monitoring:
  # Population Stability Index (PSI) limit. 
  # Values > 0.2 indicate significant distribution shift
  psi_alert_limit: 0.2 
  # The window of time (in days) used for rolling performance metrics
  rolling_window_days: 7
